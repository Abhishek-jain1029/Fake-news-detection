This is a Machine Learning Project,Which detects the trueness probability of certain statement.

The training of model is done by creating our own dataset, which is as follows:
           - labelled/Unlabelled data is taken from kaggle
		   - Data is scrapped from google news feed-(news Hedaings) -- using BeautifulSoup4
		   - Data is scrapped from legit Twitter news feed- (top tweets) -- using Selenium-web driver
		   - initially the unlabelled data is labelled as True news.
     *The training dataset should consist of both True news and Fake news for proper learning of the model. therefore we create our own fake news.
	       - we used Wordnet Python library for crating the fake news, which will replace particular words from the original true statement by
		     certain antonyms , thus making the statement negative and labelled as fake.

We Used 3 Algorithms for training the model, and Word2Vec trained model for converting text to numeric vector of 1*300 dimensions.
     *The Algorithms used are as follows-
	       - LR (Logistic Regression).
		   - SVM (Supprt vector machine Classifier).
		   - Frequency based algorithm.
		   
The model is finally trained on 25k training examples.
